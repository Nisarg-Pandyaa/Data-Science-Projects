# 🏫 Coders Of Karnavati University
*A Data Science Case Study & Social Network Analysis*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores a simulated **student social network** of Karnavati University.  
It models friendships between students and the community pages they follow,  
then applies **data cleaning, analysis, and graph techniques** to extract insights  
and generate simple recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw JSON data containing students, friendships, and liked pages.
- Analyze social connections to discover:
  - Mutual friendships and influencer students.
  - Popular pages across the network.
- Build a **“Pages You Might Like”** recommendation engine  
  using common-interest logic.
- Demonstrate an end-to-end **Data Science workflow**.
